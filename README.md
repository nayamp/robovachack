# robovachack
having fun with an old robovac's hardware, plus some additions


This is a project that explores the hardware of a robovac, and attempts to make an old robovac that no longer works into a useful robot in some way or another. 

i decided to start docuemnting this when pivoting from esp32/arduino to  radxa/raspberry pi, as i realized that i'd like to have multiple systems running at the same time, including movement, auxiliary tools, and potentially some simple 2-4 jointed arms.

i'm using ubuntu mate on this current rpi, but i'll probably launch a headless version with debian later. i might eventually containerize this too. for radxa i'm using armbian but i'll probably go back to the radxa debian release as i've heard its more stable.

i'll clean this up as i go.
